	Brookshear machine instructions

   	1RXY		Load register R with the value at memory address XY

   	2RXY		Load register R with the value XY

   	3RXY		Store the value in register R at memory address XY

   	40RS		Copy/move the value in register R to register S

	5RST		Add the values in registers R and S and put the answer in register T

   	7RST		Bit-wise OR the values in registers R and S and put the answer in 				register T

   	8RST		Bit-wise AND the values in registers R and S and put the answer in 				register T

	9RST		Bit-wise XOR the values in registers R and S and put the answer in 				register T

	AR0X		Rotate the contents of register R   X times to the right

	BRXY		Jump to the instruction located at memory address XY if the value in 				register R is equal to the value in register 0 (i.e. change the PC to XY)

	C000		Halt
